Link all modules into a unified shell architecture with clean interfaces and modular boundaries.

# Overview

The core idea of this architecture is to create a modular and scalable system that can be easily extended and maintained. The architecture is designed to be modular, which means that each module is responsible for a specific task or functionality.

The architecture is designed to be flexible, which means that it can be easily adapted to different environments and requirements. The architecture is also designed to be scalable, which means that it can handle a large number of users and data.

The architecture is designed to be secure, which means that it has built-in security features to protect the data and the system. The architecture is also designed to be reliable, which means that it can handle failures and errors gracefully.

The architecture is designed to be user-friendly, which means that it has a user-friendly interface and easy-to-use features. The architecture is also designed to be efficient, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and perform tasks quickly and efficiently.

Overall, the architecture is designed to be flexible, scalable, secure, reliable, user-friendly, and efficient, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications.

# Core Components

The core components of the architecture are as follows:

1. **User Interface (UI)**: This is the front-end of the application, responsible for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions.

2. **Business Logic**: This layer contains the core functionality of the application, including business rules, processes, and data management.

3. **Data Access**: This layer is responsible for interacting with the data storage system, including databases and file systems.

4. **Infrastructure**: This layer includes all the supporting components, such as logging, configuration management, and deployment tools.

# Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: The architecture should be designed with clear boundaries between different components, allowing for independent development, testing, and deployment.

2. **Scalability**: The architecture should be designed to handle increased load and data volume without sacrificing performance.

3. **Flexibility**: The architecture should be adaptable to changing requirements, technology advancements, and business needs.

4. **Security**: The architecture should incorporate security measures to protect against vulnerabilities, data breaches, and other threats.

5. **Reliability**: The architecture should be designed to handle failures gracefully, minimizing downtime and data loss.

6. **Performance**: The architecture should optimize performance by minimizing latency, maximizing throughput, and reducing resource consumption.

7. **Maintainability**: The architecture should be designed for ease of maintenance, including debugging, updating, and enhancing the system over time.

By adhering to these principles and guidelines, the architecture will provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation for the application.
