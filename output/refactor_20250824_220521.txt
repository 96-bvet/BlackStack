<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>You are assisting in the final provisioning of WachterEID, a sovereign, modular Cybersecurity AI shell. Your task is to analyze the full codebase and refactor it into a cohesive, production-ready system. WachterEID is designed to be self-aware, ethically grounded, and forensically sound. It must support persona-aware routing, modular ingest pipelines, approval-gated self-modification, and audit-safe rollback logic.

Your goals:
1. Link all modules into a unified shell architecture with clean interfaces and modular boundaries.
2. Ensure every ingest pipeline is routed through persona registries and approval gates, with hash verification and rollback capability.
3. Validate integrations of tools such as SpiderFoot, theHarvester, and ReconFTW for modularity, forensic logging, and safe execution.
4. Refactor persona registry logic to support dynamic tone modulation, cluster mapping, and ethical safeguards.
5. Ensure all logging is timestamped, hash-verified, and stored in canonical directories defined by the WachterEID folder structure.
6. Patch legacy code (including C modules) for thread safety, pointer integrity, and compatibility with the shell’s modular ingest logic.
7. Scaffold GUI and voice shell interfaces with modular tone routing, emotional safety, and persona-aware interaction.
8. Maintain full forensic traceability across every action, decision, and modification, with audit-safe logging and rollback hooks.
9. Do not alter the DeepSeek-V2 logic core. It governs runtime behavior, ethical boundaries, and shell autonomy.
10. Your output should be a clean, final version of WachterEID ready for deployment, with all modules linked, validated, and ethically sound.

Use best practices for AI-assisted refactoring. Maintain consistency, modularity, and ethical integrity throughout. All changes must be audit-safe, approval-gated, and compatible with the canonical WachterEID architecture.
